# Subscribe
***

The subscribe with a context subscribes the currently active context client to the given topics.
By default it doesn't block the console like the [Subscribe](/docs/subscribe) without a context does.
To enable this behavior you can use the **-s** option.


## Synopsis

```
client@host> sub    -t <topics> [-t <topics>]... 
                    [-q <qos>]... 
                    [-oc] 
                    [-of <receivedMessagesFile>]
                    [-b64]
                    [-J]
                    [-T] 
                    [-up <userProperties>]... 
                    [-s]   
                    [-h]                                           
```

##  Options

|Option    |Long Version | Explanation                  | Default  |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------|----------|
| ``-t``   | ``--topic``| The MQTT topic the client will subscribe to. |
| ``-q`` | ``--qos`` | Use a defined quality of service level on all topics if only one QoS is specified. You can define a specific QoS level for every topic. The corresponding QoS levels will be matched in order to the given topics. | ``0``
| ``-oc``| ``--outputToConsole`` | If this flag is set the output will be printed to the console. | ``False`` 
| ``-of``| ``--outputToFile`` | If a file is given print the received publishes to the specified output file. If the file is not present it will be created. |
| ``-b64``| ``--base64``| If set the received publish messages will be base64 encoded. | ``False``
| ``-J``  | ``--jsonOutput`` | Print the received publishes in pretty JSON format. | `False`
| ``-T``  | ``--showTopics`` | Prepend the specific topic name to the received publish. | `False`
| ``-up``  | ``--userProperty`` | A user property of the subscribe message. |
| ``-s``    |   |   The subscribe emulates the same behavior as the subscribe command in non-shell mode. <br> **Note**: the subscriptions will be unsubscribed afterwards. <br> To cancel the command simply press *Enter*. |
