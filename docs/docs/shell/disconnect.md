***

> Connect a client which is identified by myClient on specific settings and disconnect it afterwards

```
mqtt> con -i myClient -h broker.hivemq.com
myClient@localhost> exit  # client is still connected
mqtt> dis -i myClient -h broker.hivemq.com

If you don't specify these the default settings for these attributes will be used which may lead to unexpected behavior.
