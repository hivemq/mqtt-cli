# Test
***
Runs tests against the specified broker to find out its features and limitations.


By default the test command will use MQTT 3 clients to test the broker first and will afterwards check the connect 
restrictions returned by a connect of a MQTT 5 client. You can alter this behavior by specifying different 
[options](#test-options) when using the command.
 
## Example   

``` 
$ mqtt test -h broker.hivemq.com
MQTT 3: OK
	- Maximum topic length: 65535 bytes
	- QoS 0: Received 10/10 publishes in 47,59ms
	- QoS 1: Received 10/10 publishes in 68,87ms
	- QoS 2: Received 10/10 publishes in 43,18ms
	- Retain: OK
	- Wildcard subscriptions: OK
	- Shared subscriptions: OK
	- Payload size: >= 100000 bytes
	- Maximum client id length: 65535 bytes
	- Unsupported Ascii Chars: ALL SUPPORTED
MQTT 5: OK
	- Connect restrictions: 
		> Retain: OK
		> Wildcard subscriptions: OK
		> Shared subscriptions: OK
		> Subscription identifiers: OK
		> Maximum QoS: 2
		> Receive maximum: 10
		> Maximum packet size: 268435460 bytes
		> Topic alias maximum: 5
		> Session expiry interval: Client-based
		> Server keep alive: Client-based
