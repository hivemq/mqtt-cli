  description: "\n# Introduction\n\nThe HiveMQ Swarm Commander REST API provides endpoints\
    \ for the following use cases:\n- Listing all scenarios\n- Adding a scenario\n\
    - Removing a scenario\n- Starting a scenario\n- Stopping a scenario\n\n## API\
    \ style\nThe Commanders's API is organized in a [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)\
    \ fashion.\n\nThe API has predictable resource-oriented URLs that consume and\
    \ return JSON with the content-type `application/json`.\nIt uses standard HTTP\
    \ response codes and verbs. All transfered scenarios are encoded with Base64.\n\
    \nThe base URL is the Host and configured port of your HiveMQ Swarm Commander.\n\
    \n## Errors\nConventional HTTP response codes are used to indicate the success\
    \ or failure of an API request.\nCodes in the 2xx range generally indicate success.\n\
    Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided\
    \ (e.g., a required parameter was omitted).\nCodes in the 5xx range indicate an\
    \ error on the server side.\n\nFor all user errors a JSON response with additional\
    \ details is returned in the format [Problem JSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807).\n\
    \n## OpenAPI\nThe HiveMQ Swarm Commander REST API provides an OpenAPI 3.0 schema\
    \ definition that\ncan be imported into popular API tooling (e.g. Postman) or\
    \ can be used to generate client-code for multiple programming languages.\n"
