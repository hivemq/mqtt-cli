  description: "\n# Introduction\n\nHiveMQ's REST API provides endpoints for the following\
    \ use cases:\n- Listing all MQTT Clients\n- Getting detailed information about\
    \ a specific MQTT client\n- Listing all subscriptions for a specific MQTT client\n\
    - Getting the connection status for a specific MQTT client\n- Creating and restoring\
    \ a backup\n- Starting and stopping a trace recording\n- Downloading backups and\
    \ trace recordings\n\n## API style\nHiveMQ's API is organized in a [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)\
    \ fashion.\n\nThe API has predictable resource-oriented URLs that consume and\
    \ return JSON with the content-type `application/json`.\nIt uses standard HTTP\
    \ response codes and verbs. Some endpoints do return files, those are using the\
    \ content type `application/octet-stream` or `application/zip`.\n\nThe base URL\
    \ is the Host and configured port of your HiveMQ instances. In most cases it makes\
    \ sense to configure a reverse-proxy or load balancer to access HiveMQ's REST\
    \ API.\n\n## Pagination\nSome endpoints support returning the results in a paginated\
    \ fashion. In those cases a cursor can be returned that contains the relative\
    \ URL for the next page.\nThe desired page size can be specified by using the\
    \ `limit` query parameter.\n\nExample URL: `http://my-broker-host:8888/api/v1/mqtt/clients?limit=100`\n\
    \nExample Response:\n```\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"client-id-1\"\
    \n    },\n\n    ...\n\n    {\n      \"id\": \"client-id-99\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"\
    _links\": {\n    \"next\": \"/api/v1/mqtt/clients?cursor=a-MvelExpd5y0SrXBxDhBvnGmohbpzwGDQFdUyOYWBACqs1TgI4-cUo-A=&limit=100\"\
    \n  }\n}\n```\nTo fetch the next page with more results, the URL `http://my-broker-host:8888/api/v1/mqtt/clients?cursor=a-MvelExpd5y0SrXBxDhBvnGmohbpzwGDQFdUyOYWBACqs1TgI4-cUo-A=&limit=100`\
    \ is called.\nIf the value for `_links.next` is not present, then this is the\
    \ last page and no further pages are available.\n\n**Note**: If a generated REST\
    \ API client is used the cursor value must be extracted from the `next URL` and\
    \ then\npassed as the cursor in the API call for fetching the next page.\n\nSteps\
    \ to use pagination in a REST API client:\n1. Returned next URL:\n```\nhttp://my-broker-host:8888/api/v1/mqtt/clients?cursor=a-MvelExpd5y0SrXBxDhBvnGmohbpzwGDQFdUyOYWBACqs1TgI4-cUo-A=&limit=100\n\
    ```\n\n2. Extract the cursor from the next URL:\n```\na-MvelExpd5y0SrXBxDhBvnGmohbpzwGDQFdUyOYWBACqs1TgI4-cUo-A=\n\
    ```\n\n3. Use the cursor in the REST API client to fetch the next page:\n```\n\
    restClient.mqttClientsGet(pageLimitForRequest, \"a-MvelExpd5y0SrXBxDhBvnGmohbpzwGDQFdUyOYWBACqs1TgI4-cUo-A=\"\
    );\n```\n\n## Errors\nConventional HTTP response codes are used to indicate the\
    \ success or failure of an API request. Codes in the 2xx range generally indicate\
    \ success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information\
    \ provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the 5xx range indicate\
    \ an error on the server side.\n\nFor all errors a JSON response with additional\
    \ details is returned in the format [Problem JSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807).\n\
    \n## OpenAPI\nHiveMQ's REST API provides an OpenAPI 3.0 schema definition that\
    \ can imported into popular API tooling (e.g. Postman) or can be used to generate\
    \ client-code for multiple programming languages.\n"

- description: "These endpoints can be used to create, download, inspect and restore\
    \ backups created by HiveMQ.\n\nMore information about the backup and restore\
    \ capabilities of HiveMQ can be found in the [HiveMQ documentation](https://www.hivemq.com/docs/hivemq/latest/user-guide/backup-restore.html).\n\
    \n### Backup Requirements\nSome prerequisites are necessary to create a backup\
    \ or restore from a backup:\n\n- All HiveMQ nodes have at least version 4.4.0\n\
    - Only one backup/restore can be executed at the same time\n\n### Export Requirements\n\
    The following requirements are necessary to successfully create a backup:\n\n\
    - All HiveMQ nodes have at least 1GB of free disk space\n- No cluster topology\
    \ changes occur during the export. The backup is aborted when the topology changes\
    \ to avoid inconsistent data in the backup.\n\n\n### Restore Requirements\n\n\
    The requirements to successfully restore data from a backup are:\n\n- A clean\
    \ HiveMQ deployment. This means that no clients must be connected and no persistent\
    \ data exists on every HiveMQ node. The import will not start if there is data\
    \ available in your cluster.\n- Message data used by Extensions are only restored\
    \ if the corresponding extension is already started before the restore is started."

- description: "A Trace Recording is a combination of filters which allows you to\
    \ select messages of specific clients or topics, which are logged to a file in\
    \ a human readable format.\nEach trace recording creates cluster-wide trace files\
    \ that can be downloaded as a collective zip file.\n\nYou can log any MQTT message\
    \ sent or received by the broker with a filter you apply. A Filter can either\
    \ be a client identifier or a topic. Many filter combinations are possible. All\
    \ filters are regular expressions.\n\nThese endpoints can be used to create, download,\
    \ inspect, stop and delete trace recordings.\n\nMore information about the trace\
    \ recording capabilities of HiveMQ can be found in the [HiveMQ documentation](https://www.hivemq.com/docs/hivemq/latest/control-center/analytic.html#trace-recording).\n"

- description: "These endpoints can be used to inspect the MQTT clients that are known\
    \ to HiveMQ.\n\nWith millions of connected clients, keeping track of specific\
    \ clients can become a challenge. The HiveMQ REST API provides endpoints to list\
    \ and view all the MQTT clients known to HiveMQ. \nInformation about subscriptions,\
    \ connection status, TLS, and more, offer detailed insights into every client."
