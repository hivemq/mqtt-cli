# Installation
***
## Prerequisites

At least Java 8 is required to run MQTT CLI.

The CLI is implemented with the [11.0.4 Java release](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot) which is the preferred version to run this project.


## Docker

You can run MQTT-CLI on every OS which supports Docker.
To execute a simple command use the following syntax:

```
docker run hivemq/mqtt-cli <your-command>
```

To start the Shell-Mode of the CLI you need to add the `-it` flags to the docker-command:
```
docker run -it hivemq/mqtt-cli shell
```

## Homebrew
For **Mac OS X** and **Linux** systems use **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** to install MQTT CLI via the **[MQTT CLI Tap](https://github.com/hivemq/homebrew-mqtt-cli)**.
```
$ brew install hivemq/mqtt-cli/mqtt-cli
```


> **NOTE**: If you encounter an error like `Java 1.8+ is required to install this formula` please install a java version higher than 1.8.
You can use `brew cask install adoptopenjdk` to install the latest release of adoptopenjdk.

> **NOTE**: As latency-issues may slow down the CLI under **Mac OS X** please verify that you have the entry ``127.0.0.1 localhost your-pc-name`` specified under ``/etc/hosts``.
You can use ``sudo sh -c "echo 127.0.0.1 localhost $(hostname) >> /etc/hosts"`` to append this configuration to your hosts file.

***

## Windows Zip

Download the [Windows Zipfile](https://github.com/hivemq/mqtt-cli/releases/download/v4.6.1/mqtt-cli-4.6.1-win.zip) and extract it in your preferred location.
To execute MQTT CLI simply open the Windows Command Prompt with `âŠž Win` + `R` and execute `cmd`.
Navigate into the extracted MQTT CLI folder and execute `mqtt-cli.exe`.

To quick start the shell simply double-click the `mqtt-cli-shell.cmd` file.

```

```
